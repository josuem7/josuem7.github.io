    <p> I choose these images because they reminded me whenever i would log into a computer and these are the strongest
        ones that are deep nostalgic for me. The pinball is probably the one that i interacted with the most. The windows
        one is probably the first thing that i would see when my mom got a laptop for the first time. Minesweeper reminds
        much of one the my old housses growing up for some reason.
