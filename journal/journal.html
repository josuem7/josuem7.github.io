    <h1> My journal</h1>
    <h2> Nostalgic</h2>

    <img src="images/oldscreen.jpeg"/>
    <img src="images/windows.jpeg"/>
    <img src="images/minesweeper.jpeg"/>
    <img src="images/myspace.jpeg" />
    <img src="images/Pinball.png" />

    <p> I choose these images because they reminded me whenever i would log into a computer and these are the strongest
        ones that are deep nostalgic for me. The pinball is probably the one that i interacted with the most. The windows
        one is probably the first thing that i would see when my mom got a laptop for the first time. Minesweeper reminds
        much of one the my old housses growing up for some reason.

    <h1> Project 1 idea</h1>

        <p>im planing on making a website talking about the 4 characters from the show Atlanta. 
            I want each character to have its own page. I want to make it simple and i want to 
            have aspects from the series corporated into the website.</p>

    <h1> Inspiring site 1</h1>
