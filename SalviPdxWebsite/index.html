<div><h1>about us</h1></div>
<div><p class="about-content">Antonio Garcia and Denice Garcia Zelaya, husband and wife team, and owners of Salvi PDX LLC. 
    We specialize in making Salvadoran cuisine with a modern twist. We partner up with local breweries and have a mission to bring our Salvadoran flavors and culture to Portland and the Pacific Northwest. We offer GF and Vegan options as well as private catering. 
    The Salvi PDX vision started with Denice’s grandmother. We took her dream of one day opening up her own restaurant and made it a reality. With her recipes and background in culinary, we have been able to learn and share the delicious food with all of you. We have been able to open food carts, and are using them as a stepping stone for our future plans.
    Salvi PDX had been in operation for a little over a year and through hard work and determination, we have been fortunate enough to have partnerships with Leikam Brewing and Brewery 26. Thanks to everyone for supporting our small business. 
    Gluten Free? Find us at our new location, Groundbreaker brewing for our 100% gluten free menu options. </p></div>
